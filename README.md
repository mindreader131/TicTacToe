# TicTacToe
Person 1: Michael Zigray
Person 2: Ian Wong

Had problems with different commit histories with the master branch
so Person1 is the master branch, and Person1Again is the branch Michael
was using as his side branch.

Program plays a small game of tic tac toe in the terminal. User inputs 
two numbers in range [0,2]. Alternates turns of 'X' and 'O' players.

Running the program:
/*First pull from Player1 Branch*/
g++ .\TicTacToe.cpp -o tictactoe
.\tictactoe.exe
